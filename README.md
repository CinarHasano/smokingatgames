# Gaming & Smoking Behavior – DSA210 Project

## Project Overview
This project explores whether my daily habits influence the number of cigarettes I smoke while gaming. By systematically tracking my daily routines and gaming sessions, I will analyze the relationship between various lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep duration, study hours, meals, and socialization time) and my smoking behavior during gameplay.  

The goal is to determine if specific daily patterns significantly impact my in-game smoking frequency. This project follows the **data science pipeline**, covering **data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing**. The final outcome will present data-driven insights using statistical techniques and machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset will be self-collected daily over a predefined period (e.g., one to three months). The dataset includes the following variables:

### Independent Variables (Daily Habits)
- **Sleep Duration:** Total sleep hours per night  
- **Study Hours:** Time spent attending lectures and self-studying  
- **Meal Frequency:** Number of meals consumed per day  
- **Socialization Time:** Hours spent socializing outside  
- **Exercise:** Minutes of physical activity per day  

### Dependent Variable
- **Cigarettes Smoked While Gaming:** The number of cigarettes consumed specifically during gaming sessions  

### Additional Metadata
- **Date:** The specific day of data collection  
- **Gaming Duration:** Total time spent gaming on a given day

## Data Collection Methodology
Data will be **manually recorded** using self-logging and time-tracking applications. A structured spreadsheet will be maintained to ensure data accuracy. To minimize bias:  
- Data will be logged **at the end of each day** to maintain consistency.  
- Additional notes will be recorded for anomalies (e.g., sickness, stress, or external factors affecting habits).  
- Outliers will be identified and addressed during the data preprocessing phase.

## Analysis Plan
1. **Data Collection Phase:** Gather data for at least one month to ensure enough observations for meaningful statistical analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify trends, distributions, and correlations using visualizations.  
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Apply statistical tests to examine whether daily habits significantly influence in-game smoking frequency.  
4. **Machine Learning Modeling:** If applicable, explore predictive models to classify or predict smoking behavior while gaming.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** – for data processing and analysis  
- **Pandas** – to manipulate and preprocess the dataset  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization (scatter plots, heatmaps, trend analysis)  
- **SciPy** – for hypothesis testing and regression analysis

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:  
- Do daily habits have a measurable impact on smoking frequency during gaming?  
- Are there specific factors (e.g., sleep, study hours, or stress) that significantly influence smoking behavior?  
- Can predictive models be built to forecast smoking behavior while gaming?  

The findings from this project aim to provide **insightful, data-driven conclusions** about the intersection of lifestyle habits, gaming, and smoking behavior.
